title: Input & events
---

Sliver Engine provides keyboard and mouse events with propagation control, plus ergonomic decorators like:
- `@onClick`, `@onHover`, `@onMouseWheel`, `@onKeyPressed` (and combos)
- `@onChildrenEvents`, `@grabbable()`

If you use decorators, make sure `experimentalDecorators: true` is enabled in your TypeScript config.
