`GameObject` is the base building block in Sliver. Most of your gameplay code lives in objects: players, enemies, UI widgets, triggers, effects, etc.

At runtime, a `GameObject` can:

- Update on every tick (`tick()`)
- Draw on every frame (`render(...)`)
- React to input via decorated `handleEvent(event)` (see [`Input & events`](./events.md))
- Participate in collisions via hitboxes (see [`Physics`](./physics.md))
- Communicate through the [`GameContext`](./game-context.md) message bus
- Own `children` (a parent/“mothership” relationship)

## Creating a GameObject

The base constructor is:

```ts
new GameObject(name, position, visible?, active?, hitboxes?, scene?, children?, showOriginDebug?)
```

Most of the time you either:
- subclass `GameObject`, or
- create one and assign runtime behavior with `setTickFunction` / `setRenderFunction`.

## Tick vs render

Sliver’s loops are split (see [`Game loop`](./game-loop.md)):

- `tick()` runs at the game tick rate (default 60 TPS) and is where you update state.
- `render(canvas, scene)` runs every animation frame and is where you draw based on current state.

### `tickFn` and `renderFn` (runtime-swappable behavior)

Each `GameObject` has a `tickFn` and `renderFn` that are called from `tick()` / `render()`. You can replace them at runtime:

```ts
gameObject.setTickFunction((obj) => {
  // logic for the current “state”
});

gameObject.setRenderFunction((obj, canvas) => {
  // draw for the current “state”
});
```

This is a simple way to implement state machines without subclassing:

```ts
import { GameObject, Vector } from "sliver-engine";

const npc = new GameObject("npc", new Vector(200, 200));

const idle = () => npc.setTickFunction(() => {
  npc.speed = Vector.zero();
});

const flee = () => npc.setTickFunction(() => {
  npc.speed = new Vector(-2, 0);
});

idle();

// later, switch behavior instantly
npc.onMessage("npc:flee", () => flee());
```

Why it works well in Sliver:
- `tickFn`/`renderFn` are called *after* key-tick decorators and *before* physics integration, so they’re a natural place to update speed/rotation/state.
- Swapping functions is cheap and keeps call sites explicit (“set the object into flee mode now”).

## Visibility and activity

- `visible`: if `false`, the object won’t render (children won’t render either).
- `active`: if `false`, the object won’t tick (children won’t tick either).

`destroy()` is the common way to remove an object:

- marks it inactive and invisible
- detaches it from its parent (if any)
- destroys children
- removes it from the scene’s object list

## Position, scene space, and camera offset

There are two important coordinate spaces:

- **scene/world space** (your “real” coordinates)
- **canvas space** (scene space plus the scene’s camera offset)

Use:

- `getScenePosition()` for world logic (pathing, physics reasoning, storing positions)
- `getPosition()` for rendering and pointer hit-testing (it includes the scene offset)

`getPosition()` adds the scene’s `offset` automatically, so when you pan the camera (or run a slide transition), objects render and interact correctly.

## Children and the “mothership” relationship

A `GameObject` can own children:

```ts
parent.addChild(child);
```

What this does:
- sets the child’s “mothership” (`child.getMotherShip()`)
- propagates `scene` and `GameContext` into the child
- ensures child ticks and renders with the parent

### Relative positioning

Children are not automatically positioned relative to their parent. If you want a child’s position to be relative to the parent:

```ts
child.setPositionRelativeToMotherShip(true);
```

When enabled, the child’s world position becomes:

`motherShip.absolutePosition + child.localPosition`

This is useful for things like a health bar attached to a character, or a weapon attached to a player.

## Input and event handling (decorators)

`handleEvent(event)` is where objects react to input, and the default pattern is to use decorators on `handleEvent`.

The base `GameObject.handleEvent` already includes `@onHover` / `@onStopHovering` to maintain `gameObject.hovering`, so your override should usually call `super.handleEvent(event)`.

See [`Input & events`](./events.md) for:
- click/hover/wheel decorators
- key decorators (`@onKeyPressed` for one-shot, `@onKeyHold` for continuous; combos too)
- composition (stacking multiple decorators)

## Messaging between GameObjects

Objects communicate through the `GameContext` message bus (publish/subscribe). `GameObject` exposes small wrappers:

### Send

```ts
this.sendMessage("ui:clicked", { id: "start" });
```

That publishes on the global message bus and sets `sender` to the current object.

### Listen

```ts
const unsubscribe = this.onMessage<{ id: string }>("ui:clicked", (payload, sender) => {
  if (payload.id === "start") {
    // react
  }
});

// call unsubscribe() when you no longer need it
```

Use messages when you want loose coupling (UI talks to gameplay without direct references, enemies broadcast “died”, etc.).

## Collisions, hitboxes, and physics hooks

To make an object participate in collisions, give it one or more hitboxes and set physics flags (`immovable`, `mass`, `restitution`, etc.).

Collision flow is:
- `beforeColision(other)` (return `false` to ignore)
- `onColision(other, penetration)` (react to overlap)

See [`Physics`](./physics.md) for hitbox creation, triggers (`solid: false`), and how impulses/translation are applied.

## Scene control from a GameObject

Since a `GameObject` has access to the [`GameContext`](./game-context.md), you can switch scenes from inside an object:

```ts
const ctx = this.getContext();
if (!ctx) return;

ctx.setCurrentScene("main");
ctx.pushScene("pause");
await ctx.transitionToScene("level2", transition, "replace");
```

## Walker (pathing/movement helper)

Sliver includes a `Walker` helper you can attach to an object via `setWalker(...)`. It can move an object along waypoints and optionally avoid obstacles.

See [`Walker`](./walker.md) for usage and configuration.
